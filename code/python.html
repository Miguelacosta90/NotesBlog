  <h1>Data types</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Boolean Values</b>: Boolean Values assesses the Truth value of something. it has only two values: <b>True and False</b>. </li>
        <br>
      <li><b># Numbers #</b>: int (whole numbers), floating point numbers (commonly known as decimal numbers), and complex numbers.</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>Strings</b>: String is a text literal, most pages on the Web work with strings often</li>

    </ul>
  <h1>Composite types</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Tuples</b>: A Tuple is a(n) Array that can not be changed after you make it or in other words: A Data type that is <b>IMMUTABLE</b> ( can't be modified after its created ) <br> and can hold a group of values.Tuples can also contain mixed data types.</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>List</b>: in Python List is a(n) array or in other words: A type of data that is mutable and can hold a group of values. Usually meant to store a collection of related data. </li>
        <br>
      <li><b>Dictionaries</b>: A group of key-value pairs. Dictionary elements are indexed by unique keys which are used to access values</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>Indentation & Line-Endings</b>: One of the most important aspects of Python is indentation. Python has no brackets, braces, or keywords to indicate the start and end of certain code blocks such as functions, if statements, and loops. The only delimiter is the colon (:) and the indentation of the code itself. You'll see that indenting starts a new code block and un-indenting ends that block. Don't worry if these codes don't make sense right now; we'll go over function and i f- statements later. Just take note of how the indentation looks.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Strings</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Strings</b>: are any sequence of characters (letters, numerals, ~($/}\#, etc.) enclosed in single or double quotes.</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>Printing Strings using Variables</b>: There are multiple ways that you can print a string containing data from variables.  The first is by adding a comma after the string, followed by the variable. Note that the comma is outside the closing quotation mark of the string. Print inserts a space between elements separated by a comma. The second is by concatenating the contents into a new string, with the help of +.</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>.format()</b>: you can use curly brackets - {} - and the string .format() method to inject variables into your string - this is known as string interpolation.</li>
      <h3>Built-In String Methods</h3>
      <li><b>miguel.capitalize()</b>: Create a copy of the string with only its first character capitalized.</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>hello MIGUEL.lower()</b>: Return a copy of string converted to all-lowercase.</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>miguel ACOSTA.swapcase()</b>: Return a copy of a string with uppercase characters converted to lowercase, and vice versa.</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>.upper()</b>: Return a copy of a string converted to all uppercase.</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>Miguel.find(substring)</b>: Determine if a specified string (in this example, 'el') occurs in a given string and returns the index or location of where the substring ('el') occurred from the string. If not found, it will return -1 as a result.</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>miguel.replace(old, new [, max])</b>: This method returns a copy of the string with all occurrences of substring old replaced by new. If the optional argument max is given, only the first number of times indicated in max will you have the substring old replaced.</li>
        <br>
      <h3>here is a link for the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.6/library/string.html">Python Docs</a> on what you can do with Strings</h3>
    </ul>
    <h1>List</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><b>List</b>: also known as an array in other programming languages, is a data type that allows you to hold groups of values. Think of a list like a dresser with multiple drawers in which each drawer stores some information. Lists are created with values inside of square brackets [], where each value is separated by a comma. After a list is created, it can still be updated by adding values and/or by deleting values. An empty list is simply [ ]. In Python, the elements of a list do not have to be of the same data type. A list can be a mixture of any Python data types, including, tuples, strings, numeric, and even a list itself (a list within a list)</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>Accessing Values</b>: Back to the dresser analogy, imagine that each drawer is numbered starting with 0. Say the first drawer( index of 0) has 'documents' inside, the second drawer (index 1) has 'envelopes' inside, and so on. Each drawer holds a number, also known as the index (which serves as the unique address that points to each of our items inside the drawer). You can access the items in the drawer</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>Manipulating Lists</b>: these are some methods that we will use to manipulate lists</li>
        <ul>
          <li>list<b>.append</b>(new_element) - Appends a new item onto the end of the given list. You can pass any data type into this function.</li>
            <br>
          <li>list<b>.insert</b>(index, new_element) - Inserts a new item into the list at the given index. You can pass any data type into this function.</li>
            <br>
          <li>list<b>.remove</b>(element) - Remove the first item from the list whose value is provided. Errors if the element does not exist</li>
            <br>
          <li>list<b>.pop</b>(optional_index) - Remove the item at a given position; if the position is not given, it will remove the last entry from the list</li>
            <br>
          <li>list<b>.sort()</b> - Sorts the elements in a list in ascending order by numerical value, or alphabetically in the case of strings. Try sorting an array with mixed data types. What causes this behavior?</li>
            <br>
          <li><b>Slice</b> - Uses [ ] characters to return a copy of the list, constrained to the specified indices. The starting index and ending index should be separated by the ":" character.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
       <li><b>List Built-in Functions</b>: Below are some built-in functions that deal with lists. The following functions can also be applied to all sequences, including tuples and strings. What do we mean when we say sequence? Think of a sequence as anything over which we can iterate.</li>
         <ul>
           <li><b>len()</b> - Returns the number of items in a sequence</li>
             <br>
           <li><b>max()</b> - Returns the largest item in the sequence.</li>
             <br>
           <li><b>min()</b> - Returns the smallest item in the sequence. When comparing boolean to numbers, True == 1 and False == 0. Comparing items of differing types are quite uncommon, but if you ever do this, note that all numbers < all dictionaries < all lists < all strings < all tuples.   Again ask yourself what causes this behavior. How would you go about finding out?</li>
             <br>
           <li><b>any()</b> - Returns True if there exists any item in the sequence which is True.</li>
             <br>
           <li><b>all()</b> - Returns True if all items in the sequence are True.</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>These are just some of the things you can do to manipulate or extract information from a list. <a href="http://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/programming_books/python_programming/python_ch14s07.html">Click here</a> to learn more about other built-in functions you can use with a list.</h3>

    </ul>
    <h1>Conditional Expressions</h1>
    <ul>
      <p>* Conditional statements or expressions in Python can be done using if (and else) just like in other programming languages. We use these conditional statements with logic operators to control the flow of our programs.</p>
      <li><b>if, else & elif</b>:The if and if-else statements in Python are straightforward and are very much like the if statements in other languages. The only difference with Python's if statement is, when you have another condition, you write it using elif.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>elif</b>: Elif is just like else if or elsif from other languages.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Comparison and Logic Operators</h3>

  <p>*Note: != can also be written <>, but this is an obsolete usage kept for backwards compatibility only. New code should always use !=.  Documentation can be <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html">found here.</a></p>
  <h1>Loops</h1>
  <p>Imagine that you are in 1st grade and you got in trouble in class for talking too much (it happened to me a lot of times). Your teacher asks you to write "I will not talk in class" 1,000 times. Yikes! If you had learned to program in kindergarten, you might have thought to write a program that uses a loop to do it for you!</p>
  <h3>For Loops</h3>
  <p>We use the for loop when we know how many times we have to repeat our code. You will mostly be using for loops in your programs, particularly in Python.</p>
  <div class="loop">
    <P>
      for i in range(0,5)
      <br>>>>>>>print "this is the loop ", i
      <br>#this is how you print numbers in a for loop
      <br>#the out put will loop like so
       </P>
         <ul>
           <li>this is the loop 1 </li>
           <li>this is the loop 2</li>
           <li>this is the loop 3</li>
           <li>this is the loop 4</li>
           <li>this is the loop 5</li>
         </ul>
     </div> <!-- loop -->
       <p>
         Python's for statement iterates over the items of any sequence(list or string), in the order they appear in the sequence. In the above example, we iterated through the range from 0 to 5 (exclusive) and printed out a 'looping - ' item in the sequence. Notice how we use count as a counter/variable to refer to the current item in our loop.
       </p>
     <h3>Looping Through a List</h3>
     <p>Often you'll find yourself wanting to loop through a list. Here's a quick example of how you do that. If we execute this program, you'll see each value in our list printed.</p>
     <div class="loop">
       <p>
        #creat a new list
        <br>
        #remember lists an hold many data-types, even lists!
        <br>
        my_list = [4, "dog", 99, ["miguel","alex","list"],"HelloWorld"]
        <br>
        for element in my_list:
        <br>
        >>>>print element
       </p>
        <ul>
          <li>4</li>
          <li>dog</li>
          <li>99</li>
          <li>["miguel","alex","list"]</li>
          <li>HelloWorld</li>
        </ul>
     </div><!--loop-->
     <h3>While Loops</h3>
       <p><b>While loops</b> are offten used when we don't know how many times we have to repeat a block of code we know we have to do it until a certain condition is met.</p>
       <div class="loop">
         <p>
             count = 0
             while count < 5: #notice the colon!
             <br>
             >>print "looping - ", count
         </p>
         <ul>
           <li>this is the loop 1 </li>
           <li>this is the loop 2</li>
           <li>this is the loop 3</li>
           <li>this is the loop 4</li>
           <li>this is the loop 5</li>
         </ul>
       </div><!--loop-->
       <h3>loop control</h3>
       <b>Break</b>
       <p>
         We were introduced to control flow in the previous tabs with if and else statements. Loops, breaks and continues are all a part of control flow as well. Control flow is the cornerstone of most programming languages The break statement exits the current loop prematurely, resuming execution at the first post-loop statement, just like the traditional break found in C or JavaScript.
          The most common use for the break is when some external condition is triggered, requiring a hasty exit from a loop. The break statement can be used in both while and for loop. When loops are nested, a break will only exit from the innermost loop.
       </p>
         <div class="loop">
         <p>
           for Val in "String"
           <br>
           >>>if val == "i":
           <br>
           >>>>>break
           <br>
           >>>print (val)
         </p>
          <ul>
            <li>s</li>
            <li>t</li>
            <li>r</li>
          </ul>
        </div><!--loop-->
        <b>Continue</b>
        <p>
           The continue statement returns the control to the beginning of the loop. The continue statement rejects -- or skips -- all the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop,
            and continues normal execution at the top of the loop. The continue statement is very useful when you want to skip one or more loop iterations, but keep looping to the end.
        </p>
        <div class="loop">
        <p>
          for Val in "String"
          <br>
          >>>if val == "i":
          <br>
          >>>>>continue
          <br>
          >>>print (val)
        </p>
         <ul>
           <li>s</li>
           <li>t</li>
           <li>r</li>
           <li>i</li>
           <li>n</li>
           <li>g</li>
         </ul>
       </div><!--loop-->
       <b>Pass</b>
       <p>
         The pass statement is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute.
         The pass statement is a null operation; nothing happens when it executes.
         The pass is almost never seen in final production, but can be useful in places where your code has not been completed yet.
       </p>
        <div class="loop">
          <p>
            for val in my_string:
            <br>
            >>>>pass
          </p>
        </div><!--loop-->
        <b>Else</b>
        <p>
          There are certain conditions that we give for every loop that we have, but what if
          the condition was not met and we still would like to do something if that happens?
          We can then use else. Yes, that is right, else in a loop.
          Note that this else code section is only executed if the while loop runs normally and its conditional is false
          (whether we never entered the while loop, or we did but eventually the conditional changed from true to false).
          If instead our while loop is exited prematurely because of a break or return statement, then the else code section will never be executed.
        </p>
        <div class="else">
          <p>
            x = 3
            <br>
            y = x

        <h1>Functions</h1>
        <p>
          A function is a named block of code that we can execute to perform a specific task. More simply, a function is a list of instructions
          that you can run at any time. If you find something that you seem to be using over and over again, it might be best to have a way to
          streamline the process. A function can optionally take in parameters, perform a series of instructions, and optionally return something
          afterwards. Here's an example:
        </p>
        <h3>Functions in Python are known as "First Class"</h3>
        <p>
          Like most modern programming languages, <b>Functions in Python are First-Class Functions</b>. This means that they can basically go wherever they want!
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Functions can be stored as standalone functions</li>
          <li>Functions can be defined inside Classes/Instances (known as methods)</li>
          <li>Functions can be passed as arguments to functions (known as callbacks)</li>
          <li>Functions can be returned from functions (creating a closure)</li>
          <li>Functions can be anonymous which are stored in variables/used only one time (known as lambdas)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Syntax</h3>
        <p>
          We'll focus on standalone functions to get you familiar with the different aspects of functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The def keyword signifies the declaration of a function. This indicates that the following code is
          a function and assigns a name to that function, so we can call it later. Parameters are information
          we input into a function, and appear inside the parenthesis that follow the function name.
          We have declared a function with the def keyword, named it add, and it takes two inputs (parameters).
          An important thing to know is that the above code does not actually invoke the function; it just declares
          it. Once you've defined your function, we can execute it by invoking or calling it using () after the function
          name. It is very important to remember the following: a functional call is equal to whatever that function returns.
          Once invoked, a function can give us an output. Some functions take an input and some functions don't give us an output.
          Even if no output is produced, the code inside the function can alter the program - this is called a side effect.
          Based upon what we learned above, a function that doesn't return anything would produce no output!

        <h3>Function Parameters</h3>
        <p>
          We define the input of functions using parameters. Like we've seen before,
          some functions do not have to take parameters.However, functions can optionally
          have one or more parameters.
