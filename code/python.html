  <h1>Data types</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Boolean Values</b>: Boolean Values assesses the Truth value of something. it has only two values: <b>True and False</b>. </li>
        <br>
      <li><b># Numbers #</b>: int (whole numbers), floating point numbers (commonly known as decimal numbers), and complex numbers.</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>Strings</b>: String is a text literal, most pages on the Web work with strings often</li>

    </ul>
  <h1>Composite types</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Tuples</b>: A Tuple is a(n) Array that can not be changed after you make it or in other words: A Data type that is <b>IMMUTABLE</b> ( can't be modified after its created ) <br> and can hold a group of values.Tuples can also contain mixed data types.</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>List</b>: in Python List is a(n) array or in other words: A type of data that is mutable and can hold a group of values. Usually meant to store a collection of related data. </li>
        <br>
      <li><b>Dictionaries</b>: A group of key-value pairs. Dictionary elements are indexed by unique keys which are used to access values</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>Indentation & Line-Endings</b>: One of the most important aspects of Python is indentation. Python has no brackets, braces, or keywords to indicate the start and end of certain code blocks such as functions, if statements, and loops. The only delimiter is the colon (:) and the indentation of the code itself. You'll see that indenting starts a new code block and un-indenting ends that block. Don't worry if these codes don't make sense right now; we'll go over function and i f- statements later. Just take note of how the indentation looks.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Strings</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Strings</b>: are any sequence of characters (letters, numerals, ~($/}\#, etc.) enclosed in single or double quotes.</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>Printing Strings using Variables</b>: There are multiple ways that you can print a string containing data from variables.  The first is by adding a comma after the string, followed by the variable. Note that the comma is outside the closing quotation mark of the string. Print inserts a space between elements separated by a comma. The second is by concatenating the contents into a new string, with the help of +.</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>.format()</b>: you can use curly brackets - {} - and the string .format() method to inject variables into your string - this is known as string interpolation.</li>
      <h3>Built-In String Methods</h3>
      <li><b>miguel.capitalize()</b>: Create a copy of the string with only its first character capitalized.</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>hello MIGUEL.lower()</b>: Return a copy of string converted to all-lowercase.</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>miguel ACOSTA.swapcase()</b>: Return a copy of a string with uppercase characters converted to lowercase, and vice versa.</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>.upper()</b>: Return a copy of a string converted to all uppercase.</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>Miguel.find(substring)</b>: Determine if a specified string (in this example, 'el') occurs in a given string and returns the index or location of where the substring ('el') occurred from the string. If not found, it will return -1 as a result.</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>miguel.replace(old, new [, max])</b>: This method returns a copy of the string with all occurrences of substring old replaced by new. If the optional argument max is given, only the first number of times indicated in max will you have the substring old replaced.</li>
        <br>
      <h3>here is a link for the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.6/library/string.html">Python Docs</a> on what you can do with Strings</h3>
    </ul>
    <h1>List</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><b>List</b>: also known as an array in other programming languages, is a data type that allows you to hold groups of values. Think of a list like a dresser with multiple drawers in which each drawer stores some information. Lists are created with values inside of square brackets [], where each value is separated by a comma. After a list is created, it can still be updated by adding values and/or by deleting values. An empty list is simply [ ]. In Python, the elements of a list do not have to be of the same data type. A list can be a mixture of any Python data types, including, tuples, strings, numeric, and even a list itself (a list within a list)</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>Accessing Values</b>: Back to the dresser analogy, imagine that each drawer is numbered starting with 0. Say the first drawer( index of 0) has 'documents' inside, the second drawer (index 1) has 'envelopes' inside, and so on. Each drawer holds a number, also known as the index (which serves as the unique address that points to each of our items inside the drawer). You can access the items in the drawer</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>Manipulating Lists</b>: these are some methods that we will use to manipulate lists</li>
        <ul>
          <li>list<b>.append</b>(new_element) - Appends a new item onto the end of the given list. You can pass any data type into this function.</li>
            <br>
          <li>list<b>.insert</b>(index, new_element) - Inserts a new item into the list at the given index. You can pass any data type into this function.</li>
            <br>
          <li>list<b>.remove</b>(element) - Remove the first item from the list whose value is provided. Errors if the element does not exist</li>
            <br>
          <li>list<b>.pop</b>(optional_index) - Remove the item at a given position; if the position is not given, it will remove the last entry from the list</li>
            <br>
          <li>list<b>.sort()</b> - Sorts the elements in a list in ascending order by numerical value, or alphabetically in the case of strings. Try sorting an array with mixed data types. What causes this behavior?</li>
            <br>
          <li><b>Slice</b> - Uses [ ] characters to return a copy of the list, constrained to the specified indices. The starting index and ending index should be separated by the ":" character.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
       <li><b>List Built-in Functions</b>: Below are some built-in functions that deal with lists. The following functions can also be applied to all sequences, including tuples and strings. What do we mean when we say sequence? Think of a sequence as anything over which we can iterate.</li>
         <ul>
           <li><b>len()</b> - Returns the number of items in a sequence</li>
             <br>
           <li><b>max()</b> - Returns the largest item in the sequence.</li>
             <br>
           <li><b>min()</b> - Returns the smallest item in the sequence. When comparing boolean to numbers, True == 1 and False == 0. Comparing items of differing types are quite uncommon, but if you ever do this, note that all numbers < all dictionaries < all lists < all strings < all tuples.   Again ask yourself what causes this behavior. How would you go about finding out?</li>
             <br>
           <li><b>any()</b> - Returns True if there exists any item in the sequence which is True.</li>
             <br>
           <li><b>all()</b> - Returns True if all items in the sequence are True.</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>These are just some of the things you can do to manipulate or extract information from a list. <a href="http://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/programming_books/python_programming/python_ch14s07.html">Click here</a> to learn more about other built-in functions you can use with a list.</h3>

    </ul>
    <h1>Conditional Expressions</h1>
    <ul>
      <p>* Conditional statements or expressions in Python can be done using if (and else) just like in other programming languages. We use these conditional statements with logic operators to control the flow of our programs.</p>
      <li><b>if, else & elif</b>:The if and if-else statements in Python are straightforward and are very much like the if statements in other languages. The only difference with Python's if statement is, when you have another condition, you write it using elif.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>elif</b>: Elif is just like else if or elsif from other languages.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Comparison and Logic Operators</h3>

  <p>*Note: != can also be written <>, but this is an obsolete usage kept for backwards compatibility only. New code should always use !=.  Documentation can be <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html">found here.</a></p>
  <h1>Loops</h1>
  <p>Imagine that you are in 1st grade and you got in trouble in class for talking too much (it happened to me a lot of times). Your teacher asks you to write "I will not talk in class" 1,000 times. Yikes! If you had learned to program in kindergarten, you might have thought to write a program that uses a loop to do it for you!</p>
  <h3>For Loops</h3>
  <p>We use the for loop when we know how many times we have to repeat our code. You will mostly be using for loops in your programs, particularly in Python.</p>
  <div class="loop">
    <P>
      for i in range(0,5)
      <br>>>>>>>print "this is the loop ", i
      <br>#this is how you print numbers in a for loop
      <br>#the out put will loop like so
       </P>
         <ul>
           <li>this is the loop 1 </li>
           <li>this is the loop 2</li>
           <li>this is the loop 3</li>
           <li>this is the loop 4</li>
           <li>this is the loop 5</li>
         </ul>
     </div> <!-- loop -->
       <p>
         Python's for statement iterates over the items of any sequence(list or string), in the order they appear in the sequence. In the above example, we iterated through the range from 0 to 5 (exclusive) and printed out a 'looping - ' item in the sequence. Notice how we use count as a counter/variable to refer to the current item in our loop.
       </p>
     <h3>Looping Through a List</h3>
     <p>Often you'll find yourself wanting to loop through a list. Here's a quick example of how you do that. If we execute this program, you'll see each value in our list printed.</p>
     <div class="loop">
       <p>
        #creat a new list
        <br>
        #remember lists an hold many data-types, even lists!
        <br>
        my_list = [4, "dog", 99, ["miguel","alex","list"],"HelloWorld"]
        <br>
        for element in my_list:
        <br>
        >>>>print element
       </p>
        <ul>
          <li>4</li>
          <li>dog</li>
          <li>99</li>
          <li>["miguel","alex","list"]</li>
          <li>HelloWorld</li>
        </ul>
     </div><!--loop-->
     <h3>While Loops</h3>
       <p><b>While loops</b> are offten used when we don't know how many times we have to repeat a block of code we know we have to do it until a certain condition is met.</p>
       <div class="loop">
         <p>
             count = 0
             while count < 5: #notice the colon!
             <br>
             >>print "looping - ", count
         </p>
         <ul>
           <li>this is the loop 1 </li>
           <li>this is the loop 2</li>
           <li>this is the loop 3</li>
           <li>this is the loop 4</li>
           <li>this is the loop 5</li>
         </ul>
       </div><!--loop-->
       <h3>loop control</h3>
       <b>Break</b>
       <p>
         We were introduced to control flow in the previous tabs with if and else statements. Loops, breaks and continues are all a part of control flow as well. Control flow is the cornerstone of most programming languages The break statement exits the current loop prematurely, resuming execution at the first post-loop statement, just like the traditional break found in C or JavaScript.
          The most common use for the break is when some external condition is triggered, requiring a hasty exit from a loop. The break statement can be used in both while and for loop. When loops are nested, a break will only exit from the innermost loop.
       </p>
         <div class="loop">
         <p>
           for Val in "String"
           <br>
           >>>if val == "i":
           <br>
           >>>>>break
           <br>
           >>>print (val)
         </p>
          <ul>
            <li>s</li>
            <li>t</li>
            <li>r</li>
          </ul>
        </div><!--loop-->
        <b>Continue</b>
        <p>
           The continue statement returns the control to the beginning of the loop. The continue statement rejects -- or skips -- all the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop,
            and continues normal execution at the top of the loop. The continue statement is very useful when you want to skip one or more loop iterations, but keep looping to the end.
        </p>
        <div class="loop">
        <p>
          for Val in "String"
          <br>
          >>>if val == "i":
          <br>
          >>>>>continue
          <br>
          >>>print (val)
        </p>
         <ul>
           <li>s</li>
           <li>t</li>
           <li>r</li>
           <li>i</li>
           <li>n</li>
           <li>g</li>
         </ul>
       </div><!--loop-->
       <b>Pass</b>
       <p>
         The pass statement is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute.
         The pass statement is a null operation; nothing happens when it executes.
         The pass is almost never seen in final production, but can be useful in places where your code has not been completed yet.
       </p>
        <div class="loop">
          <p>
            for val in my_string:
            <br>
            >>>>pass
          </p>
        </div><!--loop-->
        <b>Else</b>
        <p>
          There are certain conditions that we give for every loop that we have, but what if
          the condition was not met and we still would like to do something if that happens?
          We can then use else. Yes, that is right, else in a loop.
          Note that this else code section is only executed if the while loop runs normally and its conditional is false
          (whether we never entered the while loop, or we did but eventually the conditional changed from true to false).
          If instead our while loop is exited prematurely because of a break or return statement, then the else code section will never be executed.
        </p>
        <div class="else">
          <p>
            x = 3
            <br>
            y = x

        <h1>Functions</h1>
        <p>
          A function is a named block of code that we can execute to perform a specific task. More simply, a function is a list of instructions
          that you can run at any time. If you find something that you seem to be using over and over again, it might be best to have a way to
          streamline the process. A function can optionally take in parameters, perform a series of instructions, and optionally return something
          afterwards. Here's an example:
        </p>
        <h3>Functions in Python are known as "First Class"</h3>
        <p>
          Like most modern programming languages, <b>Functions in Python are First-Class Functions</b>. This means that they can basically go wherever they want!
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Functions can be stored as standalone functions</li>
          <li>Functions can be defined inside Classes/Instances (known as methods)</li>
          <li>Functions can be passed as arguments to functions (known as callbacks)</li>
          <li>Functions can be returned from functions (creating a closure)</li>
          <li>Functions can be anonymous which are stored in variables/used only one time (known as lambdas)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Syntax</h3>
        <p>
          We'll focus on standalone functions to get you familiar with the different aspects of functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The def keyword signifies the declaration of a function. This indicates that the following code is
          a function and assigns a name to that function, so we can call it later. Parameters are information
          we input into a function, and appear inside the parenthesis that follow the function name.
          We have declared a function with the def keyword, named it add, and it takes two inputs (parameters).
          An important thing to know is that the above code does not actually invoke the function; it just declares
          it. Once you've defined your function, we can execute it by invoking or calling it using () after the function
          name. It is very important to remember the following: a functional call is equal to whatever that function returns.
          Once invoked, a function can give us an output. Some functions take an input and some functions don't give us an output.
          Even if no output is produced, the code inside the function can alter the program - this is called a side effect.
          Based upon what we learned above, a function that doesn't return anything would produce no output!
        </p>
        <div class="loop">
          def add(a,b):
          <br>
          >>>x = a + b
          <br>
          >>>return x
          <br>
          print add(3,5)  ####outpiut is 8
        </div><!--loop-->
        <h3>Function Parameters</h3>
        <p>
          We define the input of functions using parameters. Like we've seen before,
          some functions do not have to take parameters.However, functions can optionally
          have one or more parameters.We've defined the say_hi function with one parameter
          called name. Now, we can invoke this function by calling its name and passing
          in the correct number of arguments: Wait, but what's the difference between a
          parameter and an argument? These two words get mixed up a lot in programming.
          In this example 'name' is a parameter while "Michael", "Andrew", and "Jay", are
          arguments. We define parameters. We pass in arguments into functions.
        </p>
        <div class="loop">
          def sayHi(name):
          <br>
          >>>print "Hi " + name
          <br>
          sayHi("Miguel")  ### output will be "Hi Miguel"
        </div>
        <h3>Returning Values</h3>
          <p>
             So far none of our functions had any value that we could hold onto. In many cases,
             we would want our function to return some sort of value that we can use later in
             our program. Let's modify our original say_hi function and observe the differences:
             Returning a value from a function allows us to store that value in a variable.
             In this example, we invoked the say_hi function and set it to the greeting variable.
             When we print greeting we see that it contains
             the returned value of the say_hi function - "Hi'
             Going back to our add function, recall that it takes two parameters and returns the
             sum of the parameters.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Returning a value from a function allows us to store that value in a variable.
              In this example, we invoked the say_hi function and set it to the greeting variable.
              When we print greeting we see that it contains the returned value of the say_hi function - "Hi'
          </p>
          <div class="loop">
            def sayHi():
            <br>
            >>>return "HI"
            <br>
            greeting = sayHi()
            <br>
            print greeting  ### output will be, HI
          </div>
          <p>
            Going back to our add function, recall that it takes
            two parameters and returns the sum of the parameters.
            What do you think the values of sum1, sum2, and sum3 would be?
          </p>
          <div class="loop">
            def math(a, b):
            <br>
            >>>x = a + b
            <br>
            >>>return x
            <br>
            sum1 = math(4, 6)
            <br>
            sum2 = math(1, 4)
            <br>
            sum3 = sum1 + sum2
          </div>
          <p>
            If you guessed 10, 5, and 15, respectively, good job! sum1 was set to
            the return value of the add function invoked with 4 and 6 as arguments.
            Similarly, sum2 was set to the return value of invoking add with 1 and 4.
            The variable sum3 contains the sum of sum1 and sum2 which is 15. Storing
            these return values in variables allows us to use the results of our functions
            throughout the rest of our program.In our examples you may have noticed
            that our functions were returning values of different data types. Functions
            can return any of the data types - strings, numbers, lists, tuples, dictionaries
            and even other functions!

          <h1>Debugging in Python</h1>
          <p>
            Debugging is an important skill in any language. We're going to reiterate a
            few principles your instructor may have already spoken about. It's important
            to be able to understand what is happening when your code runs.
            You'll get a long way to debugging your code using just print statements.
            Although print statements will be especially key as you learn to code, they're
            going to be an important tool for the rest of your coding career. Without some
            way of visualizing your code, it's easy to lose track of what's going on. Try
            running the code examples below to get the most out of this lesson. Let's take
            a look at some code we've tried for the multiply section of the previous assignment:
            You might have discovered this problem yourself and had to work it out. Without some
            more information you might have had a hard time tracking down where the problem was occurring.
            We can get information by using print statements to display that data in the terminal.
            The first thing to do is to step through your code in the order it runs and try to figure
            out if there are any unknowns. Let's step through the example code. What runs first? The
            first line is a function, so the interpreter runs in this order:
          </p>
          <div class="loop">
            def multiply(arr,num): #don't go inside the function until the function is called
            <br>
            a = [2,4,10,16]
            <br />
            b = multiply(a,5) # now our function executes; what is a function call equal to?
            <br>
            print b # and the resulting value is printed
          </div>
          <p>
            So far, we don't have too many questions. Here's what happened, in order:
          </p>
          <div id="orderdList">
            <ol>
              <li>declare a function</li>
              <li>instantiate a variable whose value is a list containing integers</li>
              <li>print the output of that function by calling it after a print statement</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <p>
            Now comes the first unknown. Ask yourself what is your input, and what do you expect
            as output. If you get unexpected results, you should work to eliminate all unknowns.
            Try inserting a print statement as the first line. Sometimes it's useful to insert a
            print just to be sure code is executing when we think it is, but more often we can
            get more information by displaying some data we've passed into our function. Our code
            should now look like this:
          </p>
          <div class="loop">
            def multiply(arr,num):
            <br>
            >>>print arr, num
            <br>
            >>>for x in arr:
            <br>
            >>>>>>x *= num
            <br>
            >>>return arr
            <br>
            a = [2,4,10,16]
            <br>
            b = multiply(a,5)
            <br>
                # output:
                <br>
                [2,4,10,16] 5
                <br>
                [2,4,10,16]
          </div>
          <p>
            Our output confirms that our code is doing everything we've tested for so far.
            Now to prove that our next line runs as expected. This line: for x in arr:
            indicates the start of a for loop. Let's confirm we're entering the loop, and
            that "x" contains the value we expect. Now our code looks like this:
          </p>
          <div class="loop">
            def multiply(arr,num):
            <br>
              >>> print arr, num
              <br>
               >>>for x in arr:
               <br>
                  >>>>>> print x
                  <br>
                  >>>>>> x *= num
                  <br>
              >>> return arr
              <br>
            a = [2,4,10,16]
            <br>
            b = multiply(a,5)
            <br>
            print b
            <br>
              # output:
              <br>
              [2,4,10,16] 5
              <br>
              2
              <br>
              4
              <br>
              10
              <br>
              16
              <br>
              [2,4,10,16]
          </div>
          <p>
            Now we know the loop is completing as expected and that, as our loop runs,
            x is equal to every value in the list in sequence. Now it gets a little more c
            omplicated. What should we ask ourselves next? Knowing what is the most useful
            thing to print is a skill you will acquire over time. Next, let's check if
            we're successfully changing our x value.
          </p>
          <div class="loop">
            def multiply(arr,num):
            <br>
            >>>print arr, num # output should be [2,4,10,16] 5
            <br>
            >>>for x in arr:
            <br>
            >>>>>>print x
            <br>
            >>>>>>x *= num
            <br>
            >>>>>>print x
            <br>
            >>>return arr
            <br>
            a = [2,4,10,16]
            <br>
            b = multiply(a,5)
            <br>
            print b
            <br>
            # output:
            <br>
            >>>[2,4,10,16] 5
            <br>
            >>>2
            <br>
            >>>4
            <br>
            >>>10
            <br>
            >>>16
            <br>
            >>>10
            <br>
            >>>20
            <br>
            >>>50
            <br>
            >>>80
          </div>
          <p>
            Now, we've learned that our loop is, indeed changing the x value. So far, so good.
            Next, let's ask if our array is changing when we expect it to. Our code should look
            like this
          </p>
          <div class="loop">
            def multiply(arr,num):
            <br>
            >>>print arr, num # output should be [2,4,10,16] 5
            <br>
            >>>for x in arr:
            <br>
            >>>>>>print x
            <br>
            >>>>>>x *= num
            <br>
            >>>>>>print arr
            <br>
            >>>return arr
            <br>
            a = [2,4,10,16]
            <br>
            b = multiply(a,5)
            <br>
            print b
            <br>
            # output:
            <br>
            >>>[2,4,10,16] 5
            <br>
            >>>2
            <br>
            >>>4
            <br>
            >>>10
            <br>
            >>>16
            <br>
            >>>[2,4,10,16]
            <br>
            >>>[2,4,10,16]
            <br>
            >>>[2,4,10,16]
            <br>
            >>>[2,4,10,16]
          </div>
          <p>
            Aha! Here's some unexpected output. Now we know how to use print statements to find out where a problem is occurring. Once we've discovered that, we can make an educated guess as to what we should be searching. Formulating a good search is a skill best learned by trial and error. Try searching "unable to modify list value in for loop python"
            Learning to search effectively is a skill that's built over time. Don't forget to always specify the programming language you're working with. Over time Google will learn that you're a developer, but until then, you may even have to specify that you're looking for information on the Python programming language, not trying to purchase a pet snake!
            Your search will lead you to the discovery that the x in our for loop is just a pointer, and once changed, does not change the value in the array itself. How can you solve this problem?
          </p>
          <div class="loop">
            def multiply(arr,num):
            <br>
            >>>for x in range(len(arr)):
            <br>
            >>>>>>arr[x] *= num
            <br>
            >>>return arr
            <br>
            a = [2,4,10,16]
            <br>
            b = multiply(a,5)
            <br>
            print b
            <br>
            # output:
            <br>
            >>>[10,20,50,80]
          </div>
          <p>
            Learning to use print statements to their greatest advantage and how to correctly search for answers are not one-time skills. You can't just do this assignment and move on, or assume that we'll tell you when you need to use these skills. What we've introduced here is a skill set you'll use for every assignment in all of your code forever. Now is the time to start practicing, because the better you get, the more self-sufficient you become.
            If you ever need help figuring out what to search, try collaborating with your neighbor or asking an instructor to help you out. Always remember the 20 minute rule!
